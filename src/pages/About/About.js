                            A tour operator is a business that typically combines and organizes accommodations, meals, sightseeing and transportation components. in order to create a package tour. They advertise and produce brochures to promote their products, holidays and itineraries.

                            <br />
                            The most common example of a tour operator's product would be a flight on a charter airline, plus a transfer from the airport to a hotel and the services of a local representative, all for one price. Each tour operator may specialise in certain destinations, e.g. Italy, activities and experiences, e.g. skiing, or a combination thereof.

                            <br />
                            The original raison d'Ãªtre of tour operating was the difficulty for ordinary folk of making arrangements in far-flung places, with problems of language, currency and communication. The advent of the Internet has led to a rapid increase in self-packaging of holidays. However, tour operators still have their competence in arranging tours for those who do not have time to do DIY holidays.
